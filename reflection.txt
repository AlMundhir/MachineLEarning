The machine learning course to me was a very interesting course and being able to teach your machine to do certain things was undoable to me.
I learned how machines are being able to read the data and how it use classfication to differinate the data.
The course as overall was very useful yet i beleive the lectures could have been better. We were taught about lots of things in lectures but much of it was said varubally which makes it harder for me as student to go back if needed to the lecture or relate the lecture to assignments given.
For the future as machine learning is not a easy subject to learn i would suggest that Fontys provides their students which a student assist who is more avilable to help the students or the assignment to be done and helped in during class. I think teaching maths in earlier stage is essitinal when the course deals with alot of calculations.
During the course a lot of own time research was made to learn certain things to make the assignments and yet there was some assignmets that im still facing some problems in.
